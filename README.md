# SimpleCVLineFollower

This was my first experience with OpenCV. I implemented a simple line follower that puts a red circle on the center of a line from a video of a robot following a simulated track. 

To run the code ensure python 2 or 3 is installed, then install OpenCV as follows

Now just type
```
python pyline.py
```
